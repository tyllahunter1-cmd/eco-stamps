The Eco-Stamps smart contract is a Clarity-based sustainability rewards system built on the Stacks blockchain.
It incentivizes individuals, businesses, and communities to adopt eco-friendly practices by issuing blockchain-verified stamps as proof of sustainable actions.

Eco-Stamps can be minted, transferred, and redeemed for rewards, creating a transparent and decentralized ecosystem for environmental impact tracking.
